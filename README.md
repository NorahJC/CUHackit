# CUHackit

1/26-27/2019

Team Members: Roger, An, and Ghita

Prompt: Bettering campus-life

Project: StaySharp
Purpose: After a semester, students may need refreshers to stay sharp on the materials they have learned (pre-reqs for courses, technical interviews, etc.) 
Objective: Use AWS services in order to program Alexa with skills that we create and in order to create a Slack bot


This does not represent the project in its entirety. It just serves to give a general idea. Some screenshots and example code are given.


Skills were created for questions and facts. Alexa used questions and Slack used facts.


Project was mostly accomplished on the AWS platform (skills, code, and Slack bot configuration) .
